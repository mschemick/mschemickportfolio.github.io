						<h2> About Me</h2>
						<p> Greetings!  Iâ€™m Michael Schemick, an aspiring Data Analyst on a journey to transition from the world <br>
							of retail to the dynamic realm of data.  Eager to apply my analytical skills developed through academic <br> 
							coursework as well as self-learning to uncover meaningful insights and drive data-informed decisions.
						</p> <br>
						<p> I graduated with a bachelors in Data Analytics from Southern New Hampshire University, <br> where I cultivated a 
							solid foundation in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization. <br> Once my academic journey 
							has ended, my continued passion for data has helped me expand my skills and knowledge of data <br> which has helped me be more equipped 
							with the essential tools and knowledge needed for a successful career in data analytics.

											<h3>Data Collection</h3>
										</header>
										<p> In my experience, data collection is more than just finding the data and accessing it through a database.
										The ability to understand the goals and objectives is as important as it helps determine what type of data is needed, and whether it is accessed in a database, or research through outside means.</p>

											<h3>Data Processing </h3>
										</header>
										<p> While working on an end to end data project, when it comes to each step of the project I believe the most important step is the data cleaning process. 
										  Data entry can be messy with mistakes, missing values, and anomalies.  As a data analyst, I take this process very seriously, any anomaly could affect the results at the end
										of a project, which could steer a business in the wrong direction.</p>

											<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
										</header>
										<p> As a data analyst,it is important to ensure the results of the analysis can be understood by stakeholders so they can intrepet
										the results and put together a plan of action.  My goal is to ensure to provide the stakeholders with a story that is not only informative, but also engaging for them as well.
										With the ability to create fully intereactive dashboards in both Tableau and Streamlit, I can provide a fully engaging story which should provide enough information for the stakeholders into making
										the right decision.</p>

											<h3>Office Oddesy <br> Streamlit Dashboard</h3>
										</header>
										<p> This project was my first attempt on creating a dashboard using streamlit.  The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that will allow users to track
											the performance of the two key performance indicators (KPIs) Sales and Profit.  Users will be able to toggle between the two seamlessly to gain insight on how the business is performing.
											Furthermore, users will be able to select filters that will help users visualize the impact certain variables have on sales or profit, which will allow them to
											see which areas of the business are performing well and where the company needs improvement from. click <a href="https://github.com/mschemick/OfficeOddessy/blob/main/Super_Store_app.py">Here</a> to view the code.

											<div class="image-title1"> <h3>Austin Bikeshare <br> Data cleaning and EDA using sql</h3>
											
										<p>    This project marks my inaugural venture into utilizing SQL for data analysis. With the primary objective of honing my SQL skills, I embarked on a journey to cleanse and enhance the dataset. 
											Employing SQL, I meticulously addressed missing values and errors, while also integrating table joins and reformatting techniques to enrich the data. The ultimate aim was to prepare the dataset for the creation of purpose-driven dashboards. Furthermore, I conducted exploratory analysis, focusing on key metrics such as the average trip length for each bike ride. 
											To augment my SQL proficiency, I supplemented the analysis with Excel functions, demonstrating a holistic approach to data manipulation and interpretation.

										<header>
											<h3>Austin Bikeshare <br> data visualization using tableau</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This interactive dashboard project centers around analyzing the average bike ride length within Austin's bikeshare program. The overarching goal is to provide insights into ride patterns and behaviors. 
											The dashboard boasts interactivity, allowing users to filter data based on various parameters such as kiosk location, month, day of the week, and time of day. Through intuitive visualization, users can explore the average trip length per kiosk, as well as track how this average varies across different months, days of the week, and times of the day. By amalgamating location-specific data with temporal trends, 
											the dashboard offers a comprehensive view of bike ride dynamics, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and service optimization within the bikeshare program.

										<p> This data cleaning project centers on a comprehensive dataset encompassing residential listings within the Nashville Area. 
											The dataset contains details concerning property specifics, including prices, owner identities and addresses, property locations, and distinctive
											features such as bedroom and bathroom counts.  The primary goal of this project focuses on employing advanced data cleaning methodologies to rectify any discrepancies ensuring the data is prepared for analysis by providing accurate and reliable results.

											<h3>Instacart <br> Data Exploratory Analysis using sql</h3>
										</header>
										<p> The primary goal of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of data sourced from Instacart using SQL.  
											From within the data sourced by Instacart, six distinct datasets were used which contain crucial information pertaining to orders, 
											product categorization across departments and aisles, as well as the specifics of products which were purchased.  
											As part of the analysis, data integrity issues had to be addressed, such as missing values which prompt rigorous data cleaning procedures.  
											However, the main focus of this project was to utilize SQL techniques, such as queries, subqueries, joins, 
											and unions to perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis in an effort to uncover insights to be used when visualizing the data in a future project.
